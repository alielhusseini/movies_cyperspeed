## Getting Started with ExpoApp

Welcome to ExpoApp, your go-to mobile application for [insert purpose or description of the app]. Built using React Native and Expo, ExpoApp offers a seamless and intuitive user experience across iOS and Android devices.

# Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### npm start

Starts the Expo development server.
Scan the QR code generated by the Expo development server to open ExpoApp on your device.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm run ios

Runs the app in the iOS simulator.

### npm run android

Runs the app in the Android emulator or connected device.

### npm test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

### npm run eject

Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
